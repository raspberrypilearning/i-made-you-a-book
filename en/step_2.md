### Why are you making the book?

Think about the purpose of your book. 

It could be:
- To entertain a younger child
- To share an important message, such as encouraging recycling
- To teach someone how to do something, such as how to make your favourite food
- To tell or retell a story
- To share something about yourself
- To express yourself and be creative

### Who is it for?

Think about who you will make your book for (your **audience**).

It could be for a friend, for a family member, for a school class, for people who share a hobby, for fans of a musician, or just for yourself.
