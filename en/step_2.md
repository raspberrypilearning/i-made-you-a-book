## Your idea

Use this step to come up with your idea plan your book. You can plan however you want: by just thinking; with sticky notes; adding backdrops and sprites in Scratch; by drawing or writing; or whatever you like! 

**Tip**: Write down your main idea or tell a friend or family member. Like in the debugging story, it is easier to make a project when you can explain what your idea is.

**Tip**: Some of the best ideas come from playing. You will find good ideas by accident.

## Why are you making the book?

--- task ---

Think about the purpose of your book. 

It could be:
- To entertain a younger child,
- To share an important message such as encouraging recycling,
- To teach someone how to do something such as make your favourite food, 
- To tell or retell a story,
- To share something about yourself,
- To express yourself and be creative.

## Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your book for (your **audience**).

You can make a book for people you know. Perhaps a friend, someone in your family, a class at your school or even just for yourself. 

You can make a book for people you don't know. They could be people who share a hobby, fans of a musician, or for everyone to enjoy.
