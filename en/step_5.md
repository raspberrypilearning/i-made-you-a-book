## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas about what to add already! You could:
- Add more code to your sprites
- Add another sprite
- Record a sound 
- Create a new costume in the Paint editor

Each project in the [Examples studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29082370){:target="_blank"} has a **See inside** link, which you can use to open the project in the Scratch editor and look at the code to get ideas and see how the project works.

**Sporg goes home**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/499498152/editor){:target="_blank"}
