## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas about what to add already, or you might want to go back to the **Introduction** and look at other projects again for more inspiration.

You could:
- Add more code to your sprites
- Add another sprite
- Record a sound 
- Create a new costume in the Paint editor

Look at the projects in the ['I made you a book — Examples' Scratch studio](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29082370){:target="_blank"} to get ideas and see how the projects work.
