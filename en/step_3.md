## Plan your book 📔

Use this step to plan your book. You can plan by just thinking, adding backdrops and sprites in Scratch, or drawing or writing — or however you like!

Now, it's time to start to think about the pages (backdrops) and the characters and objects (sprites) in your book.

Open the [I made you a book starter project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/582223042/editor){:target="_blank"}. Scratch will open in another browser tab.

⏱️ Not much time? You can start from one of the [examples](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29082370){:target="_blank"}.

Use your new Scratch project to plan your book. You don't have to plan all the pages you can add more later. 

You can also use ✏️ a pencil and [this planning sheet](resources/i-made-a-book-worksheet.pdf){:target="_blank"} or a piece of paper to sketch your ideas.

Think about the backdrops and sprites:
- 🖼️ Which backdrops or background colours will you use in your book? 
- 🗒️ How will users interact with your book to turn to the next page?
- 🦁 Which characters and objects will you have in your book? 
- 🏃‍♀️ How will the sprites be animated and interact on each page?
