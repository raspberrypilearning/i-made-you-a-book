## Build and test

Now it's time to make your book. Start small, and add more to your project if you have time.

Think about the backdrops and sprites:
- Which backdrops or background colours will you use in your book? 
- How will users interact with your book to turn to the next page?
- Which characters and objects will you have in your book? 
- How will the the sprits be animated and interact on each page?

**Tip:** Remember to test your project each time you add something. It's much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

**Debug:**

+ **My sprites is showing or hiding on the wrong pages** - Check that the sprite has `when backdrop switches to`{:class="block3events"} scripts with `show`{:class="block3looks"} or `hide`{:class="block3looks"} as needed. Check that you have chosen the correct backdrop name `when backdrop switches to`{:class="block3events"}. It helps to give backdrops good names to help spot problems like this.

+ **My sprite is going upside down** — Add a `set rotation style left-right`{:class="block3motion"} or `set rotation style don't rotate`{:class="block3motion"} block.

+ **My sprite 'jumps' when it changes costume or bounces** — Make sure that the costume is centred in the Paint editor (line up the blue cross with the cross hairs in the centre of the Paint editor).

+ **My sound does not play** — Have you added a block to `play sound`{:class="block3sound"} when the sprite is clicked? If you have copied code from another sprite, you will need to add the sound to this sprite from the **Sounds** tab. Check the volume on your computer and make sure that you have not lowered the volume with code — try `set volume to`{:class="block3sound"}`100`.

+ **Other sprites keep going in front of my sprite** — Use a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block.

+ **My sprite only moves/changes once** — Put your code inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"} block so it keeps running.

+ **My pages are in the wrong order** - Check what order your backdrops are in, in the Paint Editor. Click on the Stage pane and then the Backdrops tab to view the backdrops for your project.

You might find a bug that we have not listed here. Can you figure out how to fix it?
