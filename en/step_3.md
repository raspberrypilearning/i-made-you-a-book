## Plan your book

Use this step to plan your book. You can plan by just thinking, adding backdrops and sprites in Scratch, or drawing or writing — or however you like!

### Get started

Now, it's time to start to think about the pages (backdrops) and the characters and objects (sprites) in your book.

You will need to decide in what order to plan and build your book. To get started, you could:
- Create all the pages as backdrops, or
- Get one page working first

You may not have time to add everything that you want to your book at first. That's OK — you can always come back to your project later.

Think about the backdrops and sprites:
- 🖼️ Which backdrops or background colours will you use in your book? 
- 🗒️ How will users interact with your book to turn to the next page?
- 🦁 Which characters and objects will you have in your book? 
- 🏃‍♀️ How will the sprites be animated and interact on each page?

Use your new Scratch project to plan your book. 

You can also use ✏️ a pencil and [this planning sheet](resources/i-made-a-book-worksheet.pdf){:target="_blank"} or a piece of paper to sketch your ideas.
