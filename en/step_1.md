Your book will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**project brief**</span> describes what a project must do. It is a bit like being given a mission to complete.
</p>

<div style="border-top: 15px solid #f3524f; background-color: whitesmoke; margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 10px;">

### 🎯 PROJECT BRIEF: Create a **digital book**
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Your book could be a storybook, a tutorial book, a fact book, an interactive book, or something else.

You must choose who to write the book for, such as "my little sister", "dinosaur fans", or "people who are learning to sing".  

Your book should:
+ Have multiple pages, with a way to turn to the next page
+ Have at least one sprite
+ Say or do something different on every page

Your book could:
+ Have speech or sound effects
+ Have text or art that has been created in the Paint editor
+ Have interactive features on every page
