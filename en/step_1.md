## Introduction

In this project, you will create a book in Scratch based on your own original idea. Your book will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">project brief</span> describes what a project must do. It's a bit like being given a mission to complete.
</p>

You will:
+ Think of original design ideas to create a digital book for someone specific
+ Choose which skills to use to make your idea
+ Learn how to use the project online via a web address

### PROJECT BRIEF: I made you a book
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

You need to create a **digital book**. Your book could be a story, a tutorial, a fact book, an interactive book, or something else.

You must choose who to write the book for, such as "My little sister", "Dinosaur fans", or "People who are learning to sing".  

Your book should:
+ Have multiple pages, with a way to turn to the next page
+ Have at least one sprite
+ Say or do something different on every page

Your book could:
+ Have speech or sound effects
+ Have text or art created in the Paint editor
+ Have interactive features on each page

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**digital book**</span> (or e-book) is a book created and read on a computer, tablet, phone, or other electronic device. Have you read any books on a digital device?
