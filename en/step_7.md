## What next?

You have reached the end of the [Scratch 1](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/scratch-1) pathway.

Now you can use what you have learned to make Scratch projects from your own ideas. If you need a reminder of what you have learned, you can go to the [Scratch guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-scratch).

You can also use the [Coolest Projects](https://coolestprojects.org/) [How to make a project](https://coolestprojects.org/2020/03/31/how-to-make-a-project-workbook-and-additional-resources/) resources to help you come up with original project ideas.

When you are ready to learn more Scratch skills you can start the Scratch 2 pathway where you will learn how to make decisions in your code with conditional logic and how to store information with variables.

If you want to have more fun exploring Scratch, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch&curriculum%5B%5D=%201).
