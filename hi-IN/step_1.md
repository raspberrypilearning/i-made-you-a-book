Your book will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**project brief**</span> describes what a project must do. It is a bit like being given a mission to complete.
</p>
