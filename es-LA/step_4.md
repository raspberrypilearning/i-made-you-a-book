## Construye 🧱 y prueba 🔄

Now, it's time to build your book. Start small, and add more to your project if you have time.

**Consejo:** Recuerda probar tu proyecto cada vez que agregues algo. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

### For each page 📃

--- task ---

Add the backdrop and new sprites you need for this page.

![Choose a sprite and choose a backdrop icons.](images/sprite-and-backdrop.png)

You will need to add code to set the positions and visibility of sprites on the first title page and each page after that.

```blocks3
when flag clicked

when backdrop switches to [page v]
```

[[[scratch3-show-hide-sprites-backdrops]]]

[[[scratch3-positioning-with-layers]]]

--- /task ---

### For each sprite 🐈 🐢 🎈

--- task ---

You will need to add code to each character and object sprite in your book. Consider whether they will do anything when the project starts, when the backdrop switches to a particular page or when the sprite is clicked.

```blocks3
when flag clicked

when this sprite clicked

when backdrop switches to [page v]

### Turning the page 📖

You will need a way for your reader to move to the next page in your book.

```blocks3

```

### Edit costumes 🦁 and backdrops 🖼️

**Debug:** 🐞 Es posible que en el proyecto encuentres algunos errores que necesites corregir. Here are some common bugs:

--- collapse ---
---
title: A sprite is showing or hiding on the wrong pages
---

Check that the sprite has `when backdrop switches to`{:class="block3events"} scripts with `show`{:class="block3looks"} or `hide`{:class="block3looks"} blocks as needed. Check that you have chosen the correct backdrop name in the `when backdrop switches to`{:class="block3events"} block. It helps to give backdrops names that you can understand easily, to help spot problems like this.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: A sprite is going upside down
---

Add a `set rotation style left-right`{:class="block3motion"} or `set rotation style don't rotate`{:class="block3motion"} block.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: A sprite 'jumps' when it changes costume or bounces
---

Make sure that the costume is centred in the Paint editor (line up the blue cross in the costume with the crosshair in the centre of the Paint editor).

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: A sound does not play
---

¿Ha agregado un bloque a `reproducir sonido`{:class="block3sound"} cuando sea necesario? If you have copied code from another sprite, you will need to add the sound to this sprite in the **Sounds** tab. Check the volume on your computer or tablet, and make sure that you have not lowered the volume with code — try `set volume to`{:class="block3sound"} `100`.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: Other sprites keep going in front of a sprite
---

Add a `go to front layer`{:class="block3looks"} block.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: A sprite only moves or changes once
---

Put your code inside a `forever`{:class="block3control"} block so that it keeps running.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: The pages are in the wrong order
---

Check what order your backdrops are in: click on the Stage pane and then on the **Backdrops** tab to view the backdrops for your project.
